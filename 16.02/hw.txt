AWS Homework

1- Please create an Instances with simple flask application that returns the server hostname (see the socket python library)


2- Create an image from the instance and launch a new instance from that image

3- make sure that the python is running on both servers and accessible from the internet

4- create an ALB that directs the users traffic to the python app on both instances.

confirm that the load is balanced on both instances by watching the hostname swapping each time you refresh the page.

solution:
created an ubuntu instance, added the python requirements(flask+ flask_app)
created an image from the instance
created an alb and associated both instances to the alb through the target group,
checked that both instance's hostname show on the alb and git it works just fine.
